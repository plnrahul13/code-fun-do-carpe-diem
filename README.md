Idea for Code Fun Do ++

The following idea comes in the backdrop of the devastating floods in the state of Kerala. The country saw, how organized and educated states like Kerala, too faces the wrath of nature in absence of proper planning. While little could have been done about preventing the flood, a lot could have been done to prevent the loss of life and property, had there been proper awareness about the impending calamity.
The idea being proposed by the team, very basically uses Machine Learning to predict floods based on the various patterns in meteorological parameters like rain, water level etc. which are otherwise oblivious to human thought process. For example, excessive rain in a region may lead to flooding. So, by observing the rain in the last x hours, the probability of flood may be determined. Similarly, even the water level of the river must be observed. Flood need not always happen due to rainfall directly in the region of observation. It may be due to rainfall in some other part connected by river or opening of dam upstream. Flood may also be predicted by observing the water level. If it is rising steadily, there is a chance of an impending flood. Very similarly, dam bursts also cause floods. Checking for the dam pressure patterns may also help predict floods. 
We intend to use an Artificial Neural Network with input features as the various parameters which may be indicative of an impending flood, such as the ones mentioned above; to classify whether the current set of parameters may cause a flood in the place.
